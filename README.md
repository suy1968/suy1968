 Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at Jaypee University Of Engineering and Technology(JUET, Guna), a Data Science enthusiast having a practicing background in C++ and Python programming and problem-solving. Being a part of various events and team projects in previous years, I have good team ethics and industrial skills.

I am a very curious fellow when it comes to exploring and trying out new skills. Developing new things every time is fun so I try to learn something new every day. Looking forward to more opportunities in these fields.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various types of data-based techniques and libraries.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new techniques to develop some interesting interfaces to interact with data.
